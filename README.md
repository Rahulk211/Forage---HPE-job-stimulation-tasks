HPE Software Engineering Virtual Experience 🚀


This repository contains my solutions for the Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Software Engineering Virtual Experience on Forage.
The tasks involved building a Java Spring Boot web application with RESTful APIs and writing unit tests to assess performance.

📌 Overview
This program provided hands-on experience in:
✅ Designing and implementing a RESTful web service using Spring Boot
✅ Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST) and managing employee data
✅ Writing unit tests with JUnit to validate the application
✅ Working with JSON data for API requests/responses

📝 Tasks Completed: 

1️⃣ API Proposal Document
Wrote a proposal outlining the design of a RESTful API to manage employee data.
Defined API endpoints, request/response formats, and functionalities.

2️⃣ Building the Web Server (Spring Boot)
Developed a Spring Boot application with a REST API.
Implemented GET and POST endpoints for managing employee records.
Used @RestController and @RequestMapping for API routes.

3️⃣ Writing Unit Tests (JUnit & Mockito)
Created JUnit tests to verify API functionality.
Used Mockito to mock dependencies and isolate components.
Assessed the application's performance and reliability.

🚀 Technologies Used:

Java 21
Spring Boot 3.4.2
JUnit & Mockito
Maven
Postman (for API testing)

🛠 Setup & Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/nilansh-07/HPE-Software-Engineering.git

cd HPE-Software-Engineering

Build and run the Spring Boot application:
mvn spring-boot:run

Test API endpoints using Postman or cURL:
GET all employees: GET http://localhost:8080/employees
POST new employees: POST http://localhost:8080/employees/post
